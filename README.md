Haskell is a pure functional programming language. Functional programming is a programming paradigm which is heavily based on Lambda calculus. 

The features of functional programming include good parallel processing, cleaner code, non-destructive functions, easily manageable code, constant time complexity.

At first, it is a bit difficult to work with because it is very different from the object oriented programming languages, but it is worth the effort.
