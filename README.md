Haskell is a pure functional programming language. Functional programming is a programming paradigm which is heavely based on Lambda calculus. The features of functional programming include good parallel processing, cleaner code, non distructing functions, easily manageble code, constant time complexity.
At first it is a bit difficult to work with because it is very different from the object oriented programming languages but it is worth the effort.
