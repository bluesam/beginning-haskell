-- TASK make your own last and remove function

--QUESTION what is the use of vagrant and docker
--QUESTION what is a type signature

--if there is no main, this won't compile but still could be opened in ghci by ghci someFunction.hs
-- infix operator ` allows us to write f x y as x `f` y. It is a syntactic sugar.
--(+) 2 2 equals 2+2
--(-) ((*) 6 11) 2 equals 6 * (11 - 2)
--by convention lists have s as suffix in their name. For example xs, ns, nss
--you can also name stuff as x' or x'' . Haskell allows ' as suffix in a function name
--Hungarian notation means ss as suffix means list of lists and xs means list of type x which is just a naming convention
--some ghci commands
-- type :reload in ghci to reload with the latest compiled changes
-- type the filename.hs to load it into ghci
-- :quit to exit
-- :? show all commands
-- :load name to load script name
-- : type expr to show type of expr
-- :edit name to edit script name
-- :edit to edit current script
-- :t expression to show the type of the expression such as :t "hello world" and :t not. Yes it works on functions too.
--Types like the type of length, which contain type variables, are called polymorphic, because it is like they have many different types at once.
--
--We can be even more adventurous. In Haskell, functions are just values like anything else. So, we can put functions into lists!
--
-- length [length, head]
--All elements of a list must be of the same type! Letâ€™s see what happens if this is not the case:
--
-- [True, "Hello"]
--Haskell also provides tuples. Tuples have a fixed length, but elements of different types can be combined.
--such (1, "Hello")

--what is type inference?
--how does this expression work?
--e :: t
--why does every expression have a type in Haskell?
--in GHCi the :type command calculates the type of an expression without evaluating it.

--Int is fixed precision integer
--Integer is arbitrary precision integer

--why doesn't Integer overflow but Int does?
--the type of a tuple indicates the length of the tuple too

--how is that a function is a mapping from values of one type to values of another type?
--t1 -> t2 is the type of functions that map values of type t1 to values of type t2.
--in that case t1 is the domain of the function while t2 is the range.
--what are domain and range in the above case?

--how to know when a function is receiving two ints and returns an int and when a
--function receives an int and returns a function that takes an int and returns and int
--or in other words, how to know if the function is curried or not?

--curried functions take the arguments one by one.
--what is the difference between
--add :: (Int, Int) -> Int
--add :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
--and what is the correct way to write the above type signatures?

--how can every function be turned into a curried function?
--how does partial application of function work in curried functions?

--what is the reason to use curried functions?
--in what case should one use a curried function over a non curried one?

--how is this function a curried function?
mult :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
mult x y z = x * y * z

--how is curried function different than method overloading and reusing?
--for example someMethod(arg1){do something}, someMethod(arg1, arg2){someMethod(arg1), do something}

--how is Haskell optimized for curried functions?

--what are polymorphic functions?
--what are concrete types?
--what are type variables?
--what are generics, especially in java?
--type variables start with a lower case and types start with an upper case
--type variables can be instantiated to different types in different circumstances

--the type signature of a function can tell us a little about what the function might be doing or how it works
--how to handle empty array exception when the return type is supposed to be an array?
--or to add on to that, how to return null or something of a different type than in the normal cases?
--what is the use of id function in Haskell?

--research paper to read: Philip Wadler - Theorems for Free

--what are overloaded functions in Haskell?
--how do you restrict the type of values a function can receive and process?

--what is the type of [tail, init, reverse] ?
--by using :t on the above, it is a list of a functions that receive and return a list
--do all the function in a list of functions must have the same type signature?

--this function applies a given function to a given value twice
applyTwice f x = f (f x)

--why shouldn't the humans do the type checking? why rely on the compiler for it?

--the haskell98 report seems old and deprecated, is there a newer report to check?
--it is recommended to understand Chapter 3 from Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton by reading
--chapters 3, 4 and 6 from the Haskell Language Specification.

--is it true that there are no statements in Haskell?

--what is the use of signum function?
--how to write code with brevity in python and C++?

--what is meant by pattern matching?

--this below one evaluates the both variables
--(&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
--True && True = True
-- _ && _ = False

--on the other hand this one only evaluates the first argument(for the false condition), thus being more efficient
--(&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
--True && b = b
-- False && _ = False

--patterns are matched in order kind of like if and else so be careful with the order. left to right and top to bottom
--and you can't repeat variables, for example b && b = b

--internally every non empty list is constructed using repeated use of (:) called cons
--i.e [1,2,3,4] means 1:(2:(3:(4:([])))). in pattern matching code, the later syntax is used
--for the pattern for lists, don't forget to use parenthesis.

--in haskell conditionals are expressions not statements. what is the difference between the two?

--Lambda functions have this type of syntax
--   \x = x + x
--they are expressions function type

--what is the difference between closures and lambda expressions?

--lambda function can be used to avoid inventing names if the function is used just once
--lambda functions are especially useful when currying functions because of the better expression of intent

--add x y = x+y is a syntactic sugar for
--add = \x -> (\y -> x+y)
--some people choose to not use the syntactic sugar to make it more readable

--const function in Haskell

--example of a function using lambda expression
odds n = map (\x -> x*2 +1)[0..n-1]

--what are sections in Haskell?
--can functions be used in sections too or just operators can be used in sections?

--task: make a function called safetail that is like tail but just works on empty lists too.
--define it using conditional expressions, guarded equations and pattern matching

--Dart has got optional typing.
